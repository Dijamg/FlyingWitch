# FlyingWitch 
Try the game here: https://dijamgoran.github.io/FlyingWitch/

A small java game made by the libgdx framework. All you have to do is click/tap and avoid crashing with bats and birds.

This game works on desktop and android devices. The repository contains an android apk file and an executable jar file named desktop-1.0.jar if you want to try the game on desktop or an android device without copying the code. For some reason if you dont open location folder and drag the jar to your desktop, the quality of the pictures are decreased.(atleast for me). The jar is safe even though your device might warn you.

You can find all the game code under the core folder. Desktop and Android folders contain only the
launcher classes of the desktop and android program. All pictures are drawn by me and the sounds are downloaded from a site named royalty
free sounds.

Libgdx programs are gradle projects, so you need the gradle files so all the dependencies will be taken care of by gradle during build.
