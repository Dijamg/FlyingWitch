# FlyingWitch 
Try the game here: https://dijamgoran.github.io/FlyingWitch/

A small java game made by the libgdx framework. All you have to do is click/tap and avoid crashing with bats and birds.

This game works on desktop,html and android devices.

You can find all the game code under the core folder. Desktop and Android folders contain only the
launcher classes of the desktop and android program. All pictures are drawn by me and the sounds are downloaded from a site named royalty
free sounds.

Libgdx programs are gradle projects, so you need the gradle files so all the dependencies will be taken care of by gradle during build.
